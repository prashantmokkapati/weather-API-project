# weather-API-project
Program uses the Dark Sky weather API in order to get the weather for a location and email the results to me daily at a certain time

# Why make this project?
This project was made for convenience. When I wake up in the mornings it is usually a hassle to check the weather app and look through the forecast for the day to see how I should dress, if I need to bring a jacket or sunglasses with me, etc. With this program, I get a daily email with the important details I need so that I don't have to waste those few extra minutes in the morning checking the forecast.

# How to use it?
The latitude and longitude numbers are set to the location I wanted, but they can easily be changed. So can the sender and receiver emails. I also wrote this program to send emails to a gmail account, but this can be changed by using a different smtp server. I have put notes next to the variables that need to be changed

# Further changes
I am still making changes to this program in terms of its UI and functionality and will be uploading new versions as I go along.
